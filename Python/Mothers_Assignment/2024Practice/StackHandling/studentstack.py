# Given a Dictionary Stu_dict containing marks of students for three
# test-series in the form Stu_ID:(TS1, TS2, TS3) as key-value pairs.
# Write a Python program with the following user-defined functions to
# perform the specified operations on a stack named Stu_Stk

# (i) Push_elements(Stu_Stk, Stu_dict) : It allows pushing IDs of those 
# students, from the dictionary Stu_dict into the stack Stu_Stk, who 
# have scored more than or equal to 80 marks in the TS3 Test.
# (ii) Pop_elements(Stu_Stk): It removes all elements present inside the 
# stack in LIFO order and prints them. Also, the function displays 
# 'Stack Empty' when there are no elements in the stack.

# Call both functions to execute queries.
