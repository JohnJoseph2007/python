# Consider a binary file 'INVENTORY.DAT' that stores information
# about products using tuple with the structure (ProductID,
# ProductName, Quantity, Price). Write a Python function
# expensiveProducts() to read the contents of
# 'INVENTORY.DAT' and display details of products with a price
# higher than Rs. 1000. Additionally, calculate and display the total
# count of such expensive products.
